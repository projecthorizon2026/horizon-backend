## PART 3: PRODUCT PLAN (500,000 INR BUDGET)

### Considering MOQ Constraints

Most suppliers require:
- **500-1000 pcs** per style for custom/private label

- **No MOQ** for dropshipping

### RECOMMENDED: START WITH 8 SKUs

Given your budget, here's the optimal product mix:

| # | Product | Colors | Sizes | MOQ/Units | FOB Cost | Total Cost |
|---|---------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Wireless T-Shirt Bra | 3 (Black, Nude, Rose) | 36D-44G | 150 | $4.50 | $675 |

| **TOTAL UNITS** | | | | **575** | | **$2,700** |

**Add shipping ($400) + duties ($200) = $3,300 landed cost = ₹2,74,000**

### Color Strategy (Based on Market Data)

**Core Colors (70% of inventory):**
- Black (35%) - Always bestseller
- Nude/Skin tones (25%) - Essential, offer 2-3 shades
- White/Ivory (10%) - Classic

**Fashion Colors (30% of inventory):**

## DROPSHIPPING: PROS & CONS FOR YOUR SITUATION

### PROS
- Lower upfront investment (₹50K vs ₹3L for inventory)
- Test products without risk
- No storage/warehousing needed
- Wider product selection possible
- Easy to pivot if something doesn't sell

### CONS
- Lower margins (20-35% vs 50-60%)
- No quality control
- Longer shipping times (7-20 days)
- Customer service challenges
- Amazon FBA not possible (need your own fulfillment)
- Harder to build premium brand perception

### MY RECOMMENDATION

**For 500,000 INR budget: Go HYBRID**

1. **Dropship** the full catalog (20-30 products) on your website
2. **Stock bestsellers** (5-8 products, 400-500 units) for:
   - Amazon FBA (requires inventory)
   - Faster shipping on website
   - Better customer experience
3. **Identify winners** from dropship data, then stock them

This gives you:
- Amazon presence (impossible with pure dropship)
- Website with wide selection
- Data to make smart inventory decisions
- Lower risk than full inventory model

---

## NEXT STEPS FROM YOU

1. **Pick a brand to analyze** (Torrid, Playful Promises, or other)
2. **Confirm budget allocation** (Option A, B, or C)
3. **Approve product mix** (the 5-8 SKUs I recommended)
4. **Share your contact details** for supplier emails
5. **Decide on company registration** (India or US LLC?)
